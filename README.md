SMALLHAMMER
==========================

*(By Cameron Swords, with select contributions from Andy Keep)*

**Smallhammer** is a set of vim bindings for developing Scheme code for Petite 
Chez Scheme (http://www.scheme.com/petitechezscheme.html). It is in no way 
affiliated with Cadence Research Systems and is developed independently.

Installation
==============
You want to move colors and syntax into ~/.vim/

**.vimrc** is an rc for you to consider using. It may be worth reading through
because most of it is well-documented.
